## -- Participated in a competition which was on Kaggle and main goal is: "To predict whether a customer continues with their account or closes it (e.g., churns)."

## -- Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

## -- This Repository includes colab notebook file which contains: Data cleaning and transformation, Feature importance, Model building, Comparing the models, Cross validation and overfitting test, final section where we find the probabilities of provided testing data

## -- If you like it and it helps to understand classification problem, follow me hereâœ…
